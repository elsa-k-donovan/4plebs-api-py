# 4plebs-api-py

Gets 4chan posts from the 4plebs API given a list of boards and a date range, saving into ES node.

Might add more features from https://4plebs.tech/foolfuuka/#basic-foolfuuka-search-function

## How to use it

First run

    pip install -r requirements.txt

then just use it as an executable.

Will update when args are actually implemented, for now you can hardcode the params.
